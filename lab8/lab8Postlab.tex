For your postlab \#5 assignment, you will again complete a method definition on CodingBat. This method will be called \textbf{countEvens}, it will have one integer parameter called \textit{limit} and will count all the even numbers up to and including \textit{limit} and return that sum as an integer. 

Further instructions for the method you must develop are located at the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://codingbat.com/prob/p227543
\end{verbatim}

If your method passes all the tests on CodingBat, you are \textbf{not} guaranteed to receive full credit. Your method also must conform to proper style guidelines, and you must include at least one end-of-line comment. If your method does not pass all the tests, you may receive partial credit depending on how close you are. Copy and paste your definition in to Moodle when you're finished so I know which was your best attempt (I can only see your last attempt on codingbat). 

I will grant you bonus participation credit if you're able to solve this in one line and without using a loop, but if you go this route, do try to complete at least one solution using a loop (for practice).
