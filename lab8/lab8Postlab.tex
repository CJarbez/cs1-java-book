For your postlab \#8 assignment, you will again complete a method definition on CodingBat. This method will be called \textbf{averageLabScore}, it will have one array of strings parameter called \textit{scores}, and will determine the average lab score, interpreting each of the strings in the array by their numeric score in the lab grading rubrics. 

It is suggested that you use a switch statement to complete this method. For other concerns, take a look back at your solution to the examScore problem. Further instructions and test cases for the method you must develop are located at the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://codingbat.com/prob/p257654
\end{verbatim}

If your method passes all the tests on CodingBat, you are \textbf{not} guaranteed to receive full credit. Your method also must conform to proper style guidelines, you must include at least one end-of-line comment, and you must include an appropriate javadoc comment. If your method does not pass all the tests, you may receive partial credit depending on how close you are. Copy and paste your definition in to Moodle when you're finished so I know which was your best attempt (I can only see your last attempt on codingbat).
