For your postlab \#10 assignment, to earn an A-, make sure you've completed the following before the deadline:

\begin{itemize}
\item At least 5 problems from Logic-1 in codingbat
\item At least 5 problems from Logic-2 in codingbat
\item At least 5 problems from String-1 in codingbat
\item At least 5 problems from String-2 in codingbat
\item At least 5 problems from Array-2 in codingbat
\item At least 5 problems from Array-2 in codingbat
\end{itemize}

For an A, also complete at least one problem from either String-3 or Array-3. As always, develop all of these solutions on your own without outside help. This will give you the best preparation for the final exam. If you're really stuck, ask your instructor for a hint. You don't have to turn anything in for this final postlab assignment.
