For your postlab \#4 assignment, you will again complete a method definition on CodingBat. The instructions for the method you must develop is located at the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://codingbat.com/prob/p244189?parent=/home/jkendallmorwick@missouriwestern.edu
\end{verbatim}

If your method passes all the tests on CodingBat, you are guaranteed to receive full credit. If it does not pass all the tests, you may receive partial credit depending on how close you are. Copy and paste your definition in to Moodle when you're finished.
