# cs1-java-book
A Customizable and Open-Source CS1 Textbook / Lab Manual

This book will eventually be an introduction to programming in Java beginning with [jshell scripting](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm) and focusing on learning small peices first (no 5-line "hello world"s in chapter 1). I will initially be writing to Java 10 but hope to keep this book as up to date as possible with any language features that make teaching CS1 / CS2 easier.

The book and [accompanying software](https://github.com/jmorwick/codecafe) are currently a work in progress. Collaborators welcome. See the Issues tab to see where I'm at.
