        <title>Shortcuts for Common Assignment Statements</title>
    </info>

<para>
You've now no doubt wrote a statement such as the following many times:
</para>
    
<programlisting>
i = i + 1;
</programlisting>

<para>
This happens so frequently in Java that there are several built-in shortcuts for such statements. 
For instance, if we simply want to add a value \textit{to} a variable (rather than replace a value in a variable), we could do so using the += operator. Thus, an equivalent version of the code above is the following:
</para>
    
<programlisting>
i += 1;
</programlisting>
    
<para>
We could also add 2 to the value of i the same way, or any other value we want to increment it by. Similarly, we could subtract that value from i with the -= operator. Each of the other arithmetic operators has a similar shortcut. 
</para>
<para>
Beyond these shortcuts, it's also very common that we're simply adding 1 from a variable, so there is a second shortcut that just adds 1:
</para>
    
<programlisting>
i++;
</programlisting>

<para>
Note that this shortcut can be used to simplify the string iteration example considerably, since it uses a somewhat long variable name:
</para>
    
<programlisting>
<xi:include href="count-l-in-hello.jsh" parse="text/plain"/>
</programlisting>

<para>
If you've ever heard of the programming language C++ and wondered why it was named that way, now you know. Similarly, a similar shortcut exists for subtracting 1 from a variable. 
</para>

<programlisting>
i--;
</programlisting>
