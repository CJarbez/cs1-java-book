    You can also create expressions that evaluate conditionally. These expressions use two operators in conjunction: a question mark (?) and a colon (:). Conditional expressions consist of 3 parts: a boolean expression, followed by a question mark, followed by an expression that wll be evaluated if the initial  boolean expression is true, followed by a colon, followed by an expression that will be evaluated if the initial boolean expression is false.
    For example, consider the following expression:
    </para>  
<programlisting>
    5 > 10 ? 30 : 40
</programlisting>
<para>
    This expression evaluates to the value 40 since the initial boolean expression evaluates 
    to false, the expression following the colon is evaluated. The middle expression is ignored 
    in this case. If we changed the comparison operator to &lt; 
    the conditional expression would have evaluated to 30. 
    
    Here's another example that would evaluate to the maximum of x and y:
</para>    

<programlisting>
    x > y ? x : y
</programlisting>
