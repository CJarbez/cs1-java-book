        The boolean type is useful for answering ``yes'' or ``no'' 
        quesions, such as ``is 2 equal to 1 + 1?''. We can ask these 
        types of questions with comparison operators. 
        
        The comparison operators are binary operators, just like the 
        arithmetic operators you learned last week. However, they operate 
        over values of any type, and the evaluate to a boolean value. For 
        instance, == is the comparison operator. It determines whether two 
        values are the same or not. So, to answer the question we posed in 
        the last paragraph, we could use an expression like this:
        
<programlisting>
(1 + 1) == 2
</programlisting>
        
        If you type this in to the REPL, it will evaluate to true. 
        Note that the parentheses are not necessary, either. + will be evaluated before 
        any comparison operators will be.
        There are several other comparison operators that will be useful to us, summarized below:
        
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>!=  Not equal to</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>&gt; greater than</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>&lt; less than</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>&gt;= greater than or equal to</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>&lt;= less than or equal to</para>
            </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
    </para>
        <para>
        For example, the expression 
        4 &lt; 3 + 3 would evalute to <literal>true</literal>.
