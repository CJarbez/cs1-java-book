            An <firstterm>Algorithm</firstterm> is a list of abstract instructions for solving a problem.

        These instructions need not be computer codes -- an algorithm, as a concept, transcends any one particular programming language.</para>
    
    <para>Algorithms are often used to describe how to perform a complex mathematical operation by breaking it down in to a number of smaller steps. Though algorithms are not limited to manipulating numbers, some simple numerical examples work well to get the idea across.

    <para>In this course you will write many computer programs in Java that implement algorithms. However, before we make that leap, we'll first learn about the basic building blocks of a Java program and weave them together to implement the steps in abstract algorithms.
