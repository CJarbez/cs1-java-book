            An <firstterm>Algorithm</firstterm> is a list of abstract instructions for solving a problem.

        These instructions need not be computer codes -- an algorithm, as a concept, 
        transcends any one particular programming language.

        In this course you will write many computer programs in Java that implement algorithms.
        However, before we make that leap, we'll first learn about the basic building
        blocks of a Java program and weave them together to implement the steps in abstract
        algorithms.
