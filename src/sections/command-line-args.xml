    <para>
Though you should understand what the type \textbf{String[]} means at this point (an array of string values), it may not be clear why a parameter with this type must be provided to the main method. The purpose of this parameter is to hold any \textbf{command-line arguments} that may be provided to your application when it is started at the command prompt. This would allow you to write an application similar to \textit{javac} itself! 
    </para>
    <para>
Consider the following example program:
    </para>
<programlisting>
<xi:include href="CommandLineDemo.java" parse="text/plain"/>
</programlisting>
    
    <para>
    This application prints out each of the command line arguments given to it when it is executed. These arguments are specified at the end of the \textit{java} command that starts the JRE. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
    For example, if you were to compile and run this program with the following command:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>
    java CommandLineDemo here are some arguments
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>
    ...the following would be printed to the screen:
    </para>
    
<screen>
here
are
some
arguments
