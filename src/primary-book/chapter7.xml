      You won't see as much new syntax in this chapter as you have in prior chapters. Loops look a lot like conditional statements. However, they add a level of complexity to programs that takes a lot of practice to master. Take your time with this material and read through it multiple times if necessary after going through examples, demos, and attempting practice problems.
