    <para>
        In the last unit you explored several different kinds of expressions and statements that could be combined to form programs. You also saw how methods can hide a lot of the details of a complicated operation and make your programs cleaner. Although Java makes many methods available to you, you might not have always had a method that did exactly what you wanted or even worked exactly the way you wanted it to.

    <para>
      Starting this unit, you'll begin developing your own methods. Writing methods make for good programming exercises for the same reason that they are good abstractions: you get to write a very complete, free standing piece of a program that can be re-used over and over in many programs you write! This chapter will begin with developing some methods similar to the ones you used last week.
