    <para>Loops are the last piece of the puzzle for a <emphasis>real</emphasis> programming language (or what computer scientists call a <emphasis>Turing Complete</emphasis> language). What this means is that, technically, you can now write a program that is capable of doing whatever any other program written in any other language can do.

    <para>You won't see as much new syntax in this chapter as you have in prior chapters. Loops look a lot like conditional statements. However, they add a level of complexity to programs that takes a lot of practice to master. Take your time with this material and read through it multiple times if necessary after going through examples, demos, and attempting practice problems.</para>
