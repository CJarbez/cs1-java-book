    <para>
      The only collection of data with arbitrary size we've worked with so far is String. However, instead of characters, what if you wanted to store a collection of integers, or even a collection of Strings? The array data type allows a Java programmer to do just this. This chapter will introduce arrays as well as how to work with them using loops.
