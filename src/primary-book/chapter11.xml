      In Java there is a fundamental difference between primitive types and object types. Variables that hold primitive type data (such as integers or booleans) work intuitively -- they hold the actual values you're working with. Object type variables are different. They hold a reference to the location of the object, somewhere else in memory. This has some important but subtle implications that will be explored in this chapter.
