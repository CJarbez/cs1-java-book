        Throughout the first unit we will be mostly looking at Java expressions. Think of 
        expressions as the most basic building blocks of a Java program. An expression is 
        something that is evaluated in your Java program (that is, it's interpreted to 
        represent some value). A common exercise / exam question you will have this semester 
        is ``what value does this expression evaluate to?''.

    <para>
        Throughout the first unit, you will be using a program called a REPL (Read, Evaluate,
        Print Loop) to evaluate Java expressions. If you type a 
        Java expression in to the REPL, the REPL will interpret it and print out the value 
        that it evaluates to. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
        We'll start by working with numeric expressions. These are expressions that always 
        evaluate to some sort of numeric value (such as 5, or 9.2).
