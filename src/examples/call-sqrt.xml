    <title>Calling the Square Root Method</title>
    
    <para>We will see many types of methods in future chapters, but the methods we're calling in
        this chapter are called <firstterm>static</firstterm> methods. In order to use some of the
        methods that come standard with Java, we should first import them. Typing in the following
        line will make several mathematical methods available. The method we'll use in this example
        is named <varname>sqrt</varname>).
        <programlisting>import static java.lang.Math.*;</programlisting> Note that
            <varname>Math</varname> must be capitalized and the line should end in a semicolon. Once
        you've typed this in, you're allowed to make calls to the square root function and seceral
        others at will. For example: <programlisting>sqrt(4)</programlisting> This expression should
        yield the value <literal>2.0</literal>. Note that the method returns a double value, even
        though <literal>4</literal> is a perfect square. Try calling this method with some other,
        messier values. </para>
