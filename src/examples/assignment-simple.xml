<example xml:id="ex.dssslfunction">
The following code example includes two statements. The first is a variable declaration that creates a variable 
named <varname>x</varname> of type <type>int</type>. Second is an assignment statement that will assign the value 
<literal>5</literal> to the variable <varname>x</varname>.
<programlisting>
<xi:include href="assignment-simple.jsh"/>
</programlisting>

Now evaluating the variable expression x at the shell prompt will yield the value <literal>5</literal>:
<screen>
jshell> <userinput>x</userinput>
x ==> 5

</screen>
