    <title>Declaring a Variable and Using it in an Expression</title>
    
    <para>
        We can create a variable named <varname>x</varname> which holds integer values 
        with the following statement:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>
<xi:include href="declaration-statement.jsh" parse="text/plain"/>
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>
        Once a variable is declared, you can use it as an expression (called a 
        <firstterm>variable expression</firstterm>). The expression will 
        evaluate to whatever the variable holds. Evaluating the expression x yields the value 0,
        since 0 is the default value given to a variable of type <type>int</type>. You can 
        see both the declaration statement and the variable expression being evaluted below:
    </para>
<screen>    
jshell> int x;
x ==> 0
    
jshell> x
x ==> 0
</screen>        
    
    <para>
        Note that if you use a variable in an expression before its defined, an error will result.
    </para>
<screen>
jshell> y
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   variable y
|  y
|  ^        
</screen>
