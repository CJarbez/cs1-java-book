    <title>Revisiting Averaging Several Integers</title>
    
    <para>Another method available from the import in Example 1.2 <!-- TODO: link to proper example --> is the <varname>round</varname> method that rounds a floating point value to the nearest integer value. This method abstracts away some of the details of averaging we implemented in Example 1.1. <!-- TODO: link to proper example --> For example, evaluating the expression <programlisting>average(5.9)</programlisting> yeilds the value <literal>6</literal> whereas evaluating the expression <programlisting>average(5.2)</programlisting> yields the value <literal>5</literal>. Note that this is much easier to underestand for a programmer than deciphering <programlisting>(int)(5.9 + 0.5)</programlisting> or <programlisting>(int)(5.2 + 0.5)</programlisting> which both perform the same rounding operation.</para>
