    \begin{exa}
    Let's consider a very simple algorithm for computing the average of numbers $x_{1}$ through $x_{n}$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item add each number $x_{i}$ together (for every $i$ between $1$ and $n$)
    \item divide this sum by $n$
    \item the resulting quotient is the average value
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Note that the first step involves quite a bit of work! This is what we would call a 
    relatively high-level instruction, in that it makes a rather heavy assumption about 
    the reader's problem solving knowledge (specifically, that they understand they need 
    to add $x_{1}$ to $x_{2}$, add that sum to $x_{3}$, etc...)
