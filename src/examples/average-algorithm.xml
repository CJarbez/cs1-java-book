    <title>Averaging Algorithm</title>
    <para>
        Let's consider a very simple algorithm for computing the average of numbers <varname>x<subscript>1</subscript></varname> through <varname>x<subscript>n</subscript></varname>:
    </para>
   <procedure>
       <step><para> add each number <varname>x<subscript>i</subscript></varname> together (for every <varname>i</varname> between <literal>1</literal> and <varname>n</varname>)</para></step>
       <step><para> divide this sum by <varname>n</varname></para></step>
       <step><para> the result is the average value</para></step>
   </procedure>
    <para>
    Note that the first step involves quite a bit of work! This is what we would call a 
    relatively high-level instruction, in that it makes a rather heavy assumption about 
    the reader's problem solving knowledge (specifically, that they understand they need 
    to add <varname>x<subscript>1</subscript></varname> to <varname>x<subscript>2</subscript></varname>, add that sum to <varname>x<subscript>3</subscript></varname>, etc...).
    </para>
