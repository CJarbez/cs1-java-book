    One of the essential components of any program is the ability to remember and recall values. 
    In terms of computer hardware, this is what we refer to as memory. The most basic way to utilize memory 
    in just about any programming language is by using variables.
    
    <termdef xml:id="term.variable">
        A <firstterm>variable</firstterm> is a named portion of computer memory that holds 
        a single value. 
    </termdef>
    
    
    Variables in programming are similar to the idea of a variable you've seen in algebra. In algebra, the variable 
    represents an unknown quantity. Likewise, when you write a program, you may not know what value a variable 
    you're using will eventually hold. However, at the time when your program is running
    (known as <firstterm>run time</firstterm>), the variable's value will be known to the computer, just as the
    value of a variable in algebra is known when you solve an equation.
