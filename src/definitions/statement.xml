        A <firstterm>statement</firstterm> is essentially a single instruction.
    </termdef>
    This is a fairly abstract definition, but statements serve many purposes in imperative 
    programming languages like Java and can embody simple or complex instructions. 

    <!-- TODO: replace below with a figure on statement syntax -->
    Generally, statements will end with a semicolon (think of this like the period at the end
    of a sentence in English).
