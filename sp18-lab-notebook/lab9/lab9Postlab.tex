Use a text editor or IntelliJ to develop an application in a file called MadLib.java. This should be a text-based application that prompts the user for four different strings that will be stored in four different variables. Ask the user for an adjective, a noun, an animal, and a noise. Once the user has entered all four of these values, print out the ``old macdonald'' song inserting their answers in the same manner that the following ``mad libs'' knockoff does:

Follow all posted style guidelines and use one statement to print one line of the poem. 

A sample run of the solution is below. Interactions with your program should look exactly the same. 

\begin{verbatim}
Enter an adjective: obtuse
Enter a noun: aircraft carrier
Enter an animal: basilisk
Enter a noise: screeee!
obtuse Macdonald had a aircraft carrier, E-I-E-I-O
and on that aircraft carrier he had an basilisk, E-I-E-I-O
with a screeee! screeee! here
and a screeee! screeee! there,
here a screeee!, there a screeee!,
everywhere a screeee! screeee!,
obtuse Macdonald had a aircraft carrier, E-I-E-I-O.
\end{verbatim}
