For your postlab \#7 assignment, you will again complete a method definition on CodingBat. This method will be called \textbf{noVowels}, it will have one string parameter called \textit{sentence} and will return a new string that is essentially a copy of sentence without any of the vowels remaining in it.

Further instructions for the method you must develop are located at the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
http://codingbat.com/prob/p204289
\end{verbatim}

If your method passes all the tests on CodingBat, you are \textbf{not} guaranteed to receive full credit. Your method also must conform to proper style guidelines, and you must include end-of-line comments wherever appropriate. If your method does not pass all the tests, you may receive partial credit depending on how close you are. Copy and paste your definition in to Moodle when you're finished so I know which was your best attempt (I can only see your last attempt on codingbat). 

If you have trouble completing this method, I will also award you significant credit for completing practice problems in the String-1 section of codingbat before the assignment deadline. See the grading rubric for details.
