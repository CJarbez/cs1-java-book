\subsection{Part 1 -- Manipulating Strings with Basic Expressions}

\begin{eval}
For each of the following expressions, predict what you expect the value to be on the first line (discussing it with your partner), then evaluate the expression in the REPL and confirm or correct your prediction on the second line if necessary. 
\begin{sevalenum}
\item "1 2 3".length()
\evallinetwo
\item "cats".charAt(2)
\evallinetwo
\item "thought".indexOf('h')
\evallinetwo
\item "ad astra".substring(5,5)
\evallinetwo
\item "per" + "" + "" + "aspera"
\evallinetwo
\item "you know it's " + (1 + 1 == 2)
\evallinetwo
\item "hello   there".length()
\evallinetwo
\item ("number " + (7 + 5)).length()
\evallinetwo
\end{sevalenum}
\end{eval}


\subsection{Part 2 -- Manipulating Strings with More Complex Expressions}
*** predict/evalutate difficult method calls (empty string results, missing character, missing character upper-case (but not lowercase), nested calls using substring and length, substring and indexOf)
*** predict/evaluate difficult concatenations (l-r ordering prevents addition)

*** explain errors
	*** null ptr exception w/ .length
	*** negative starting point w/ charAt
	*** charAt just over length of string (using call to length)
	*** indexOf doesn't exist, but nested in to substring call

\subsection{Part 3 -- Writing Basic Methods with Strings}

*** write a method called 'uMad' that returns true if there is an exclamation point in an input string (tell them to use indexOf)

http://codingbat.com/prob/p220491

*** write a method called firstNameOnly that returns a substring up to but not including the first space in a string (tell them to use one line with indexOf and substring)

http://codingbat.com/prob/p281900

*** update firstNameOnly to account for strings with no spaces

\subsection{Part 4 -- Processing Strings with Loops}

*** write uMad without using indexOf

*** write a method that counts the number of digits in a string

http://codingbat.com/prob/p217885

*** write a method that removes all the exclamation points from a string
